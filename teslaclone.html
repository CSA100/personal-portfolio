                    <p class="text-white-50 mb-4">Having built some sites using vanilla HTML, CSS, and javascript as a beginner to web development, I quickly embarked on a quest to learn React.js as a frontend framework. I was inspired by the design of various websites including tesla.com. Tesla's homepage had beautiful images of their products as the center of attention and a minimalist yet elegant navigation bar.</p>
                    <p class="text-white-50 mb-4">What caught my attention the most was the scroll feature on the homepage that caused the text and buttons on the site to fade in and out of view as the user scrolled down. As such, I decided to make a clone of tesla's homepage as one of my first React projects. This not only taught me the basics of React but, also put my CSS skills to the test. What I enjoyed most was putting together a function for the scroll feature of the site that took as input the scroll position and returned a value for the opacity of the buttons and other content in the viewport.</p>
                    <p class="text-white-50 mb-4">Additionally, embarking on this project made me question if my usage of React as a framework was even close to being at par with how professional developers would use it. I was unsure of the best practices when writing code with React. This set me on a path to take up multiple online courses which taught me not only about good practices such as writing readable and reusable code but also, gave me an understanding of a multitude of different concepts in web development. This included REST APIs, databases, state management, and more.</p>
